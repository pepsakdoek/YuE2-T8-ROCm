# Changelog

## 1.3.0 - 2026-09-12

- Unify generation, transcription, Seed-VC, RVC and GGUF under CPython 3.12.10 / Torch 2.10.0 + CUDA 12.8; keep sequential subprocess model release.
- Add an RVC training workbench with material preview/review, separation, preflight, progress/logs, cancellation/resume, paired checkpoints, indexes and a versioned voice library.
- Add validated storage migration for training projects/cache, datasets and voices, preserving original backups and resumable migration state.
- Convert existing songs directly or compare Seed-VC and RVC sequentially using a verified shared Demucs cache. Preserve playable successful candidates when the other backend fails.
- Migrate legacy runtimes transactionally during updates, verify new service startup, and roll back code/runtime on failure. Retire the old code-only patch installer.
- Package optional prebuilt/local SM120 FlashAttention wheels; standalone flash_attn is not enabled in song generation.
- Verify GPU/CPU compatibility, long repeated-audio conversion, checkpoint recovery and browser workflows. Voice-quality benchmarks and physical low-VRAM GPU support are not claimed.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-09-12

- Add a visible update control to the WebUI status card and automatically check the stable GitHub Release channel when the page opens.
- Download and validate the project-bound update manifest and code archive before installation, including the release URL, archive root, size limits, and SHA256.
- Install updates through a separate process, preserve models, runtimes, local LLM files, works, uploads, drafts, settings, logs, and caches, then restart the same local port.
- Back up every replaced file and automatically restore the previous code if the updated service cannot start.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-09-12

- Add channel-specific default models: `bytedance/doubao-seed-evolving` for ZhenZhen Affordable AI Shop and `gemini-3.5-flash` for ZhenZhen AI Workshop.
- Add searchable provider model choices and a bounded OpenAI-compatible `/models` refresh. A failed LIST request keeps the defaults and manual model-ID input available.
- Add the two provider registration links beside the channel settings so users can obtain the matching API key without searching elsewhere.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-11

- Add a standalone AI creation tab with the T8 project's pinned YuE2 skill rules, API provider options and isolated local GGUF support; no new ComfyUI nodes.
- Edit, save and transfer lyrics, style and validated ABC between tabs, with revision checks, overwrite review, undo and result restoration after refresh.
- Preserve completed text on failures; resume only failed stages and reuse successful responses. Keep API credentials out of jobs and prevent repeated submissions from creating duplicate paid tasks.
- Add a pinned Windows GGUF runtime installer, verified resumable downloads, packaged CUDA dependencies and metadata/shard checks without importing Torch into the LLM worker.
- Preserve assistant drafts and local models during updates; use the memory-saving generation default when importing an external score into the plan page.
- Verify the Seedance API, imported-score audio generation, browser workflows and error recovery. Local Qwen 27B lyrics/style generation passes; constrain response fields to avoid placeholder/wrong-field output. Reject over-budget prompts without truncating lyrics.
- Make the local GGUF directory optional and add a separate model download link. API users do not need local LLM weights. Local ABC quality remains model-dependent; invalid scores preserve text and can fall back to YuE2 planning.

## 1.1.6 - 2026-09-11

- Preview the source song and reference voice immediately after file selection, with native playback, seeking, duration and file replacement controls.
- Keep players outside file-input overlays, release replaced file URLs, pause the other upload preview, and show a helpful message for unsupported browser audio formats.
- Verify WAV/FLAC playback, replacement, seeking, cleanup and narrow-screen layout in the browser. This release does not change inference backends.

## 1.1.5 - 2026-09-11

- Bound NAR attention query tiles on CUDA, select supported fused kernels explicitly, and fall back to bounded math with limited OOM retries. Enable AR offload by default without truncating songs or changing BF16, seeds, CFG, or solver steps.
- Save verified plan, semantic and latent checkpoints; resume failed generation and exact-plan rendering without repeating completed stages.
- Run reference-cover generation and conversion as a persistent backend workflow with sequential GPU workers, cancellation, stage progress and resource logs.
- Save and verify voice separation/conversion checkpoints; preserve a visible result or failure card across browser refreshes and provide recovery buttons.
- Show completed audio, duration and a direct download above the current page's form. Persist its page association and selected tab, restore older cover results, and preserve the player during polling.
- Add regressions for attention correctness, OOM bounds, cancellation, checkpoint integrity, workflow ordering, page refresh and mobile failure display.

## 1.1.4 - 2026-09-11

- Add an in-page model directory setting with the active path, bundled-default reset, folder opener, model layout guidance, and a direct Hugging Face link.
- Apply the configured model root consistently to generation, transcription, score rendering, reference-voice conversion, provenance, verification, and model downloads.
- Add a command-line model path configurator and prepare code-only GitHub Release assets with checksums and a machine-readable update manifest that preserves models and user data.

## 1.1.3 - 2026-09-11

- Restore the vendored YuE2 inference package in standalone archives so generation and reference-voice cover flows can start.
- Show the final worker exception in failed jobs and add in-page task-log viewing plus buttons that open the managed log and output directories.
- Reject jobs before queueing when their generation, transcription, or voice-conversion capability is incomplete, with a specific repair message.

## 1.1.2 - 2026-09-11

- Automatically switch from another idle YuE2 installation that already owns port 8189 after verifying the exact service process and executable path.
- Refuse to switch while the other installation has a running or queued task, and identify the protected task in the launcher message.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-09-11

- Add a native `YuE2-T8.exe` launcher for the standalone Windows bundle, while keeping the batch launcher as a compatibility entry point.
- Keep launcher windows open after both successful and failed starts so the service URL or failure reason remains visible.
- Show localized runtime checks, service startup progress, stale-service guidance, and log locations instead of silently closing.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-11

- Add local zero-shot reference-voice covers with Demucs vocal separation, Seed-VC conversion, and 48 kHz stereo remixing.
- Add the `YuE2 参考音色翻唱` ComfyUI node and a fourth front-end workflow using separate source-song and reference-voice inputs.
- Add an isolated Python 3.11 voice runtime, offline model verification, detailed capability checks, and local-only worker stages.
- Redesign the WebUI cover page as two integrated choices: melody remake or reference voice, with novice guidance and advanced voice controls.
- Validate the WebUI layout, a 30-step live service conversion, and a real ComfyUI `/prompt` execution.

## 1.0.7 - 2026-09-11

- Move live task progress into the page flow above the active workspace and remove the large fixed overlay and duplicate creation status card.
- Keep the current task, stage steps, queued task order, task summaries, and cancellation controls visible in one compact section.
- Add the creator credit and direct GitHub, Hugging Face model, Bilibili, and YouTube links to the local WebUI.

## 1.0.6 - 2026-09-11

- Replace the ambiguous single-job drawer with a live task center that identifies the current task and lists every queued task in execution order.
- Show localized task types, human-readable stages, source, style summary, elapsed/submitted time, and task-specific cancellation controls.
- Lock submit buttons immediately, reflect queued/running/cancelling state in place, and restore active tasks from the server after page refresh.
- Deduplicate identical active requests server-side and remove cancelled queued work from the logical queue immediately.
- Separate runtime readiness from GPU workload, remove the misleading fake progress bar, and add responsive and reduced-motion task-center styles.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-09-11

- Bind staged inference to the exact manifest-recorded files and recursively verify plan, semantic, and latent lineage while preserving compatibility with 1.0.4 manifests.
- Protect queued and running job dependencies from retention, serialize reads and exports with cleanup, and publish exports atomically with collision-safe names.
- Reject non-loopback Host headers, acquire a per-installation instance lock and bind the service port before job recovery, and make CUDA/BF16 self-check failures explicit.
- Pin model source identities in code, make provenance comparison insensitive to unrelated manifest formatting, and reject placeholder runtime files.
- Preserve transcription errors, prevent missing ABC from silently becoming a new composition, and add transcription manifests with source-audio and output hashes.
- Refresh the local WebUI with the light pink, blue, and slate palette used by the T8star IndexTTS 2.5 integration.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-09-11

- Add independent semantic, latent, and decode manifests with file hashes, pinned model sources, runtime weight identities, and stage-to-stage lineage verification.
- Add configurable automatic retention for terminal jobs, uploads, and logs, plus manual cleanup and storage reporting in the WebUI.
